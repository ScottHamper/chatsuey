ChatSuey
========
A collection of chat enhancement addons for vanilla World of Warcraft (WoW 1.12). Learn about all the features at the [project website](https://www.scotthamper.com/chatsuey/).

Installation
------------
1. Copy all the ChatSuey folders into your WoW `Interface\AddOns` directory.
2. If WoW is currently running, exit completely out and restart it.
3. Enable/disable desired addons at the character select screen ("EditOnTop" and "RemoveButtons" are disabled by default).

NOTE: If you're upgrading from an earlier version, delete all the ChatSuey folders from your `Interface\AddOns` directory before copying the new ones over.

Localizations
-------------
ChatSuey is currently localized for the following languages/game clients:

- English (enUS)
- French (frFR)
- Simplified Chinese (zhCN)

**HUGE THANK YOU** to:
- [@eloib](https://github.com/eloib) for providing the French/Simplified Chinese translations!
- [@shikulja](https://github.com/shikulja) for providing the Russian translations!

If you're multi-lingual and would be willing to contribute another localization for ChatSuey, I would greatly appreciate your help! The following addons have text that needs to be translated:

- `ChatSuey`
- `ChatSuey-FontSettings`
- `ChatSuey-MiniChannels`
- `ChatSuey-Timestamps`
- `ChatSuey-WebLinks`

Let me know you're interested by [opening an issue or pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/ScottHamper/ChatSuey), and take a look at each addon's `i18n\enUS.lua` file to get a sense of what translations are needed.
